    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:

3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. That's it!


## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help improve the tool or add new features, please follow these steps.

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the original repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone the repository from your account to your local machine. Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/excel-pro-tools.git
cd excel-pro-tools
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Create a descriptive branch for your new feature or bug fix.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-new-formatter
```

### 4. Make and Commit Changes
Make your code changes, then stage and commit them with a clear message.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add a new date formatting tool"
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork
Push your new branch up to your forked repository on GitHub.
```bash
git push origin feature/add-new-formatter
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request
Go to the original repository on GitHub and you'll see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch. Fill out the template and submit it for review.


## üîÑ Keeping Your Fork Updated

To keep your forked repository up-to-date with the latest changes from the original (upstream) project, you should configure an `upstream` remote.

### 1. Configure the Upstream Remote
This only needs to be done once. Add the original repository as a remote named `upstream`. Replace `original-owner/original-repo` with the actual path to the original repository.
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
```
You can verify it was added by running:
```bash
git remote -v
```

### 2. Fetch Updates from Upstream
Fetch the latest changes from the `upstream` repository. This downloads the changes but doesn't merge them yet.
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

### 3. Merge Upstream Changes
Check out your main branch and merge the changes from the upstream main branch.
```bash
# Switch to your local main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the changes from the upstream's main branch into your local main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

### 4. Push Updates to Your Fork
Push the updated main branch to your own forked repository on GitHub (`origin`).
```bash
git push origin main
```
Now your fork is in sync with the original repository, and you can create new branches from an up-to-date codebase.

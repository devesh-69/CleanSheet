# Enhanced Duplisheets Features - Practical Improvements for Next.js/TypeScript

## 1. Core Service Improvements

### File Processing Enhancements

**Current State**: Support for Excel (.xlsx, .xls), CSV, TSV, and JSON. File processor automatically detects character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, Latin-1) for text files to prevent corruption. CSV parsing is robust, automatically trying comma, semicolon, and pipe delimiters. All files are limited to 50MB to ensure stability. File processor automatically detects data types (Number, Date, Email, etc.) for each column upon upload.
**Improvements**:
- **Better Data Type Detection**: [COMPLETED] Implemented a data type analyzer that uses regex and validation checks on a data sample to determine the most likely type for each column (e.g., Number, Date, Email, String). This is now integrated into the file processing pipeline.
